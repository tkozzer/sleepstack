  - [x] `sleepstack remove-ambient <sound_name>`
  - [x] `sleepstack --vibe calm -a campfire,rain,ocean -m 5`

# File Organization & Asset Management

- [x] Directory structure updates
  - [x] Maintain existing `assets/ambience/campfire/` structure

- [x] Error handling for assets
  - [x] Handle corrupted or invalid downloaded files
  - [x] Validate WAV file format and properties

  - [ ] Provide configuration reset/restore functionality

- [ ] State management
  - [ ] Track download history and metadata
  - [ ] Handle ambient sound updates and re-downloads
  - [ ] Manage asset dependencies and references
  - [ ] Implement state cleanup and maintenance

# CI/CD & Deployment

- [ ] Update CI workflow
  - [ ] Add ffmpeg installation to CI environment (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)
  - [ ] Add yt-dlp installation to CI environment
  - [ ] Update smoke tests to include new CLI subcommands

# Documentation

- [ ] Update user documentation
  - [ ] Update `_docs/technical/user-guide.md` with new features
  - [ ] Add examples for downloading and using ambient sounds
  - [ ] Document prerequisite installation (ffmpeg, yt-dlp)
  - [ ] Update README.md with new functionality
  - [ ] Document CLI subcommand usage and examples
  - [ ] Add troubleshooting guide for common issues

# Performance & Security

- [ ] Performance considerations
  - [ ] Optimize multi-ambient mixing for memory usage
  - [ ] Consider streaming for large audio files
  - [ ] Add progress indicators for long downloads
  - [ ] Implement download caching to avoid re-downloading

- [ ] Security considerations
  - [ ] Validate YouTube URLs to prevent malicious links
  - [ ] Sanitize ambient sound names to prevent path traversal
  - [ ] Add file size limits for downloads
  - [ ] Implement download timeout to prevent hanging

# Notes

- **Prerequisites**: Users must have ffmpeg and yt-dlp installed on their system
- **Audio Quality**: Downloads best available audio quality, converts to 48kHz WAV
- **File Naming**: All ambient sounds follow `<name>_1m.wav` convention
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing campfire functionality must remain unchanged
- **Error Handling**: Robust validation for URLs, file formats, and system requirements
- **Performance**: Efficient audio processing using existing numpy-based pipeline
