# Nightly Stack v2 — Meta-Core + Receptivity Updater + Domain Scripts

> **Purpose:** Run a nightly playlist where the **Meta-Core** (the “OS runtime”) always plays, a **Receptivity Updater** keeps the subconscious open to safe rewrites, and **Domain Scripts** (business/health/relationships/wealth) “hot-reload” into behavior the next day.

---

## 1) Mental OS Model

- **Kernel / Meta-Core (always on):**  
  Grants permissions, installs detectors & safe interrupts, teaches the S.A.M.B.A. rewrite loop, enforces ethics/failsafe.
  
- **Receptivity Updater (auto-tuner):**  
  Trains the system *how to stay open* to future changes: lowers friction, increases willingness, schedules micro “maintenance windows,” and prioritizes targets. Think: **plasticity manager**.

- **Domain Programs (“apps”):**  
  Affirmation scripts for specific goals (belief & behavior). They rely on the runtime and benefit from the updater’s plasticity.

- **Telemetry & GC (daytime jobs):**  
  Morning proof logs, weekly refactors, and safe “garbage collection” of stale rules.

---

## 2) Playlist Order (60 min template)

1) **Downshift** (3–4 min): safety, breath, slow cadence.  
2) **Meta-Core Runtime** (8–12 min): detectors → triggers → S.A.M.B.A. → governor/failsafe → morning bridge.  
3) **Receptivity Updater** (6–10 min): permissions to stay open, maintenance windows, priority queue, friction-reduction.  
4) **Domain Script A** (10–12 min): e.g., Business (identity & tiny next-day action).  
5) **Domain Script B** (10–12 min): e.g., Health or Relationships.  
6) **Tomorrow’s Bridge** (2–3 min): one tiny proof on wake.  
7) **Loop Hook** (≤1 min): restates the first identity line to allow seamless repeat.

> **Mix advice:** Keep Meta-Core & Updater **metric-free** and soothing. Put KPIs/dates **only** in daytime tracks.

## 3) Receptivity Updater — What It Actually Does

**Goal:** Make the subconscious **faster and kinder** at adopting new rules by improving:

- **Willingness:** “Yes to tiny edits that serve my values.”
- **Friction:** Less resistance; smoother state shift into pause/patch.
- **Timing:** Smart “maintenance windows” (brief openness moments during drowsiness or natural lulls).
- **Prioritization:** Sort targets by impact & ease.

**Capabilities (install these as suggestions/permissions):**

- **Open Window:** “When I feel safe and unhurried, you may prompt a kind micro-update.”  
- **Priority Queue:** “Prefer small, high-leverage fixes first (n < 2 minutes).”  
- **Conflict Resolver:** “If two programs clash, keep the one that preserves safety, honesty, and long-term aim.”  
- **Believability Dial:** “Auto-soften claims to ‘I’m becoming…’ when ‘I am…’ feels forced.”  
- **Rollback:** “If a change increases tension, revert and try a gentler variant next time.”  
- **Opt-out:** “Stand down” phrase halts all interventions instantly.

## 4) Patch Protocol v1.0 (S.A.M.B.A. + Updater rules)

1) **Stop** (trigger fires)  
2) **Acknowledge** (neutral label)  
3) **Map** one **90-second** step (or less)  
4) **Breathe** (long exhale marks the switch)  
5) **Act** (do it)  
6) **Write-Back** (Updater stores: context → trigger → step → result)  
7) **Believability Check** (if strain detected, downshift language for next exposure)  
8) **Priority Update** (successful patches move up in the queue)

**One-liner template for the Proof Log:**  
`[Pattern] → [Trigger used] → [Tiny step] → [Feel 1–5] → [Note]`

## 5) Script Snippets (drop-in modules)

### A) Meta-Core (runtime essentials)
>
> I am safe here. [pause]  
> Subconscious, you are trusted and capable. [pause]  
> You have permission to pause me kindly the moment tension rises or looping begins. [pause]  
> Our pause keys are: breathe out for six, thumb and index together, and the word “Soften.” [pause]  
> When a cue appears, you apply S.A.M.B.A.: stop, acknowledge, map one tiny step, breathe, act. [pause]  
> Always choose the kindest safe option. If I say “Stand down,” you stop. [pause]

### B) Receptivity Updater (plasticity manager)
>
> You may keep me **open to gentle updates** when I feel safe and unhurried. [pause]  
> Prefer **small, high-leverage** edits first. [pause]  
> If a claim feels far, soften it to **“I’m becoming…”** and proceed kindly. [pause]  
> If two rules collide, keep the one that honors safety, honesty, and long aims. [pause]  
> When an edit increases tension, **roll back** and try a gentler variant next time. [pause]  
> You may schedule brief **maintenance windows** during natural lulls for tiny improvements. [pause]

### C) Domain (Business sample, night-safe)
>
> I begin gently. [pause] One simple step opens momentum. [pause]  
> I keep promises to future-me by starting small and finishing one slice. [pause]  
> Clarity and care guide my work; I make progress in calm rhythm. [pause]

### D) Tomorrow’s Bridge
>
> Morning-me, we start with **ten quiet minutes** on the one caring task. [pause]  
> One small promise kept. [longer pause]

## 6) Daytime Sync Jobs (make it real)

- **On Wake (≤90s):** do the micro-action that was primed.  
- **During Day:** let the runtime fire triggers; accept the pause; do the tiny step.  
- **Proof Log:** 1 sentence in the tracker.  
- **Weekly GC (Garbage Collection):** archive lines that feel fully true; soften any that still snag; add a fresh example to each identity.

---

## 7) Safety & Ethics

- **Precision triggers only;** avoid words likely to misfire while driving/cooking.  
- **Kindness rule:** no shaming; interventions must feel reversible and safe.  
- **Consent:** “Stand down” stops everything; you are always in control.  
- **Night ≠ numbers:** keep metrics to daytime; night scripts nurture identity and receptivity.

## 8) Quick Build Checklist

- [ ] Choose **2 detectors** (e.g., jaw clench, tab-hopping)  
- [ ] Choose **1–2 triggers** (breath-key, tactile-key, or word-key)  
- [ ] Set **opt-out phrase** (“Stand down”)  
- [ ] Pick **one morning bridge** (10-minute block on highest-care task)  
- [ ] Record **Meta-Core** + **Receptivity Updater** + 1–2 **Domain** modules  
- [ ] Create **Proof Log** page and a Sunday **GC** reminder
