Follow this process:

1) Install all required dependencies for the current checklist section using uv.

2) Implement the relevant code for the section (initially, you may ignore lint and type errors).

3) Run `uv run` commands to test functionality and `uv run mypy` or `uv run black` to check code quality.

4) Update the checklist:
   - Mark completed items as done.
   - Add any missing details or clarifications that are informative for future reference.

5) Clearly state which section or task will be addressed next, providing a brief description or rationale.
